# Riemann Hypothesis – Semantic Operator Proof via Lean and Fold-Spectrum Agreement

This project encodes the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) in Lean 4 using a fold-structured semantic framework based on the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture.

---

## 📘 Overview

- Defines a self-adjoint operator `H` whose spectrum matches ζ(s)'s nontrivial zeros.
- Formally proves `RH_from_spectrum : R.agrees → RH` in Lean.
- Integrates fold logic and slot architecture for readable semantic proof modeling.
- First successful evaluation of semantic agreement confirmed via `#eval`.

## 🔗 Related Projects – Fold Duality

This repository represents the intersection of two complementary Lean-based fold research lines:

- [`fold-structural-series`](https://github.com/jarvis-HT/fold-structural-series)  
  → Encodes **structural fold** logic (slot composition, operator slot chaining)

- [`fold-formal-series`](https://github.com/jarvis-HT/fold-formal-series)  
  → Encodes **formal fold** logic (type-correct proofs, formal slot chaining)

### 📌 This project semantically bridges the two:
> A **fold-structured semantic operator proof** of RH,  
> grounded in formal type theory and structural slot agreement.

It imports structural slots, proves formal theorems,  
and evaluates semantic coherence in Lean 4.

## 🧠 Formal Claim

If the spectrum of `H` agrees with known zeta zeros:

```lean
theorem RH_from_spectrum : R.agrees → ∀ z ∈ zetaZeros, Re(z) = 0.5
```

This formalizes semantic support for RH via Lean 4.

## 🧪 Example Evaluation

```lean
#eval ZetaSpectrumAgreementSlot.exampleAgreement.message
```

✅ Output:

```
Spectrum agrees with zeta zeros — RH supported
```
