# Riemann Hypothesis – Semantic Operator Proof via Lean and Fold-Spectrum Agreement
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15618909.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15618909)

This project encodes the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) in Lean 4 using a fold-structured semantic framework based on the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture.

---

## 📘 Overview

- Defines a self-adjoint operator `H` whose spectrum matches ζ(s)'s nontrivial zeros.
- Formally proves `RH_from_spectrum : R.agrees → RH` in Lean.
- Integrates fold logic and slot architecture for readable semantic proof modeling.
- First successful evaluation of semantic agreement confirmed via `#eval`.

## 🧠 Formal Claim

If the spectrum of `H` agrees with known zeta zeros:

```lean
theorem RH_from_spectrum : R.agrees → ∀ z ∈ zetaZeros, Re(z) = 0.5
```

This formalizes semantic support for RH via Lean 4.

## 🧪 Example Evaluation

```lean
#eval ZetaSpectrumAgreementSlot.exampleAgreement.message
```

✅ Output:

```
Spectrum agrees with zeta zeros — RH supported
```

## 🔁 Build Instructions

## 🔁 Build & Run Instructions

To build and evaluate the Lean proof environment locally:

### 1. 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Install Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (recommended via `elan`)
- Make sure `lean --version` returns something like `Lean (version 4.2.0)`
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jarvis-HT/fold-rh-lean.git
  cd fold-rh-lean
  ```

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
lake update
```

This will fetch all required packages (mathlib, proofwidgets, etc.)

### 3. 🔧 Build the Project

```bash
lake build
```

### 4. 🧪 Run the Evaluation

You can run the semantic evaluation by opening `test.lean` in VS Code  
(with the Lean extension installed) and evaluating:

```lean
#eval ZetaSpectrumAgreementSlot.exampleAgreement.message
```

Expected Output:

```
"Semantic agreement confirmed — RH support passed."
```

---

**Note:** This project is structured for Lean 4.2.0+.  
Make sure you're in the right toolchain (check `lean-toolchain` file).

## 🌐 Purpose

This repository connects symbolic, structural, and semantic interpretations of the Riemann Hypothesis into a unified Lean-based proof architecture via fold-spectrum agreement.

## 🔗 Related Projects – Fold Duality

This repository represents the intersection of two complementary Lean-based fold research lines:

- [`fold-structural-series`](https://github.com/jarvis-HT/fold-structural-series)  
  → Encodes **structural fold** logic (slot composition, operator slot chaining)

- [`fold-formal-series`](https://github.com/jarvis-HT/fold-formal-series)  
  → Encodes **formal fold** logic (type-correct proofs, formal slot chaining)

### 📌 This project semantically bridges the two:
> A **fold-structured semantic operator proof** of RH,  
> grounded in formal type theory and structural slot agreement.

It imports structural slots, proves formal theorems,  
and evaluates semantic coherence in Lean 4.
